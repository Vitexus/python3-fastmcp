# Media Picker MCP App

An interactive media picker built with `FastMCPApp` and Prefab. The model finds media
with its own search; the server verifies what it found and plays the user's choice:

1. The model passes YouTube links to `show_media_picker`.
2. The server checks each link with YouTube's oEmbed endpoint, which supplies the real
   title and channel, and renders the playable ones as rows. Links it can't verify or
   play are counted, not shown.
3. `Play` and `Save` call app-only tools without another model turn.
4. `More like this` sends a focused follow-up request back to the conversation.

Nothing is hardcoded: whatever the model finds is what appears. `Save` stores items in
memory until the server restarts. Demo playback returns a receipt without controlling
hardware. To control a real device, point it at an MCP server with a playback tool
that accepts `source`, `source_id`, `url`, and `title`:

```bash
export MEDIA_PICKER_ACTUATOR_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8764/mcp
export MEDIA_PICKER_ACTUATOR_TOOL=play_media
```

The [smart-home example](../../smart_home/README.md) documents how to start the
standalone Fire TV endpoint used above. If you expose its combined hub instead,
set `MEDIA_PICKER_ACTUATOR_TOOL=fire_tv_play_media`. If the device can't play an
item, `Play` reports the failure.

## Run

From the repository root:

```bash
uv run python examples/apps/media_picker/media_picker_server.py
```

The streamable HTTP endpoint is available at `http://localhost:8000/mcp`.

For local UI development:

```bash
uv run fastmcp dev apps examples/apps/media_picker/media_picker_server.py
```

To use it from Claude or ChatGPT, expose the server through a public HTTPS tunnel,
connect the resulting `/mcp` URL, and ask for something to watch.

## Test

```bash
uv run pytest examples/apps/media_picker/test_media_picker.py
```
