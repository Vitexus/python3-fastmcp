"""
Public maintenance status for FastMCP.

Writes `status.json` (schema `fastmcp-maintenance/1`), `STATUS.md`, and a
shields.io `badge.json` into the output directory. Automation health comes
from each workflow's own GitHub Actions runs, so every claim links to public
evidence. Only facts are published: the contributor queue appears as how many
PRs wait and for how long. Judgments about individual PRs, even as counts,
stay private (`uv run scripts/gate_digest.py`).

Entries published by other systems are merged in from OPERATOR_STATUS_URL
when it is set, each keeping its own `as_of`.

Requires `gh` authenticated with read access.
